(View https://sites.research.google/open-buildings/)
}
\usage{
download_google_building(layer,destiny_file=path)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{layer}{
A sf object or a character. A layer or a place used to filter the buildings by location. When use sf, if the layer not is a POLYGON the st_bbox is used, note that this is less accurate and probably return unnecessary buildings.
The place is inserted in OSM API and the polygon of place is used, note that OSM API can return more than one polygon, pass a sufficiently complete address to the function.
}
  \item{destiny_file}{
A character. A path to a file with extension csv, txt or geo formats to save the outputs (see details).
}
}
\details{
When use large polygons this functions save the output by tile which requires less RAM memory but may take longer.

Output formats need be only of a list csv, txt, geojson, gpkg, kml or shp.
